### ðŸ§  Description
This simulation compares two crowd movement strategies:
- BioCrowds: based on virtual markers to guide movement. <br> _Proposed by_ [de Lima Bicho, Alessandro, et al. "Simulating crowds based on a space colonization algorithm." Computers & Graphics 36.2 (2012): 70-79](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0097849311001713).
- Boids: based on flocking rules: separation, alignment, cohesion. <br> _Proposed by_ [Reynolds, Craig W. "Flocks, herds and schools: A distributed behavioral model." Proceedings of the 14th annual conference on Computer graphics and interactive techniques. 1987](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/37401.37406).

Agents are assigned goals and navigate an environment possibly containing obstacles, using the selected behavior models.
